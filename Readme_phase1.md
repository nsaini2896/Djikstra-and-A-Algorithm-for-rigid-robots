ENPM_661 : Project3_phase1

This is our implementation for Djikstra Algorithm for rigid robots.


The contents for the project are saved in a zip folder named ENPM661_proj3_ph1, which contains :
  1. a Proj3_phase1.py file which contains the Dijkstra Code for the obstacle space.
  2. a dijkstra.avi file which contains an visualization.
  3. the url for github repo to this proj is 
  4. A readme.md file.

Libraries used:
math
queue
pygame
time
random
numpy

Steps to run the file:
1. To run the python file Proj3_phase1.py in the python IDE.
2. The user must input the x and y coordinated for both start and goal positions.
3. Later the output will be in the form of a map and a .avi video file.
